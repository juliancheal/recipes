## Ingredients

* Chicken (organic)
* Unsalted butter
* Thyme
* Lemon
* Salt & Pepper
* Carrots
* Onions
* Garlic
* Plain flour

## Method

### Part I - Preparations

Firstly preheat your oven to `240℃`

Remove the `chicken wings` (if you're unsure ask your butcher), we'll use these for the trivet.

Gently separate the `chicken skin` from the `breasts`, being careful not to rip it. To do this you can use your fingers at the beginning then use a soft spatular.

Chop the `thyme` and mix this with the `unsalted butter`.

Gently massage the `thyme butter mix` underneath the separated `chicken breast skin`. Making sure it covers as much as the `breast` as possible.

Using a sharp knife slice slits into the thickest parts of the `chicken thighs` (two or so should do) right to the bone.

Take any remaining `thyme & butter mix` and rub that into the `chicken thighs`.

Rub `salt & pepper` generously over the whole `chicken`.

Slice a `lemon` in half and place it inside of the `chicken`. Now set aside and prepare the trivet.

### Part II - The main part

Cut a couple of `carrots` and `onions` in to quarters then place them onto the centre of the oven tray along with some cloves of `garlic`. No need to peal any of the `vegetables`, but just wash it first. Take the cut off `chicken wings` and place them in the centre of the tray also.

Gently place your prepared `chicken` on top of the trivet of `vegetables`. If the `chicken` is unstable rearrange the `vegetables`.

Place your `chicken` into the oven ideally on a middle shelf. Turning down the oven to `200℃`. Now relax and have a glass of `wine.``

Baste your `chicken` halfway through cooking with the juices that are happily sitting at the bottom of the oven tray. If the `vegetables` look dry, add a splash of `water` (`wine`?) to stop them from burning.

For the last 20-30 mins cover the `chicken` with tinfoil. Use a liberal amount, we'll need this later on.

### Part III - It's almost done

Once you're happy your `chicken` is cooked remove from the oven, and admire your work!

Place your `chicken` on a board (make sure it's bigger than the `chicken` as it'll release some juices onto the board - we'll want those for later).

Wrap your `chicken` with the tinfoil and even place some tea towels on top of that to keep the `chicken` nice and warm while you make the `gravy`.

### Part IV - Gravy

Put at least one litre of `water` onto boil in the kettle. Once boiled mix this with the `stock` of your choice (`chicken, vegetable`, etc) into a jug.

Remove the `vegetables` and `chicken wings` from the tray and place to the side. We might still want to use these later.

Using a table spoon try and remove as much of the `fat` as possible (careful not remove any yummy `chicken juices`) from the oven tray, however you'll still need some `fat` so don't take it all out. It can help if you tilt the tray at an angle (don't forgot to use gloves the tray will be hot).

Once the `fat` is removed, you should have a tray full of `yummy chicken juices`. Placing the tray onto the hobs turn them to a low heat.
Add to this two tablespoons of `plain four` and mix together until thick, but not solid, this should form the basis of our `roux`.

Pouring the `stock` slowly into the tray mix using a wooden spoon and scraping any sticky bits from the bottom of the tray. Slowly mixing the `roux` and `stock` together. Turning up the heat of on the hob slightly to get a gentle simmer.

Once you're happy that all the goodness is removed from the bottom of the oven tray, pour the `gravy` into a saucepan on a gentle heat to keep warm. Add `salt & pepper` to taste.

Pour any excess juices that have escaped your wrapped up `chicken` into the `gravy` also.

*Additional:* If you want you can remove the `chicken` from the `chicken wings` and add that to the `gravy`. Also you can mash up the `garlic cloves` and add that to the `gravy`.

### Part V - Carving

Unwrap your `chicken`. Using your knife cut along the centre of the `chicken breast` following along the `wish bone` and the centre of the `breast`. You should be able to remove the two `breasts` whole. Place to the side on your serving plate

Pull of the the `chicken thighs` and separate the meat from the bones. Place alongside the `chicken breasts` on the serving plate.

There is so much meat on the `chicken` if you want to get your hands in and pull the meat off by hand. Add this to your serving plate. Underneath the `chicken` you'll find two thumb sized bits called the `chicken oysters`. Feel free to keep those for yourself dearest chef. You deserve them.

You can either leave your `chicken breasts` whole, or cut them into slices width ways.

Pour some of the `gravy` over the cut `chicken` to keep it moist and give it a nice look ready for the table.

### Part VI - Enjoy!

That's it, drink more wine, and serve your delicious `chicken`.
